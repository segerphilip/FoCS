(*

 * Please fill in this file with your solutions and submit it
 *
 * The functions below are stubs that you should replace with your
 * own implementation.
 *
 * Always make sure you can #use this file before submitting it.
 * Do that in a _fresh_ OCaml shell 
 * It has to load without any errors.

(* The underlying implementation for streams 
 *
 * Basically, a stream is a pair of an element and a 
 * "promise" to compute the rest of the stream.
 * 
 * That "promise" is represented as a function
 *
 * The implementation memoizes that function: once the function is
 * called once, it remembers its result, and subsequent calls to the
 * function directly return the result without executing the body of
 * the function
 *
 * You don't need to know anything about this code -- you will
 * use functions fby, head, and tail described below instead
